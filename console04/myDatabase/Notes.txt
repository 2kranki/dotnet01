I bought the book, "Teach yourself SQL in 10 minutes".  It is really 10 minutes
per chapter.  Anyway, I downloaded his test data and incorporated into building
the Docker Container that I want for testing.  The database did not directly
run and I had to massage it a bit to get it to work.  The database did not
contain copyright statements like Microsoft's Northwind.  I am assuming however
that it is his database as if it was copyrighted.  I could not find a public
domain sample database online.  So, I am slowly creating my own which will contain
General Ledger, Accounts Receivable and other tables.

Since I have never used "docker build" and don't have time to debug it.  I am
using a bash script to build the container for now.  I learned the "docker cp"
trick from looking at Microsoft's explanation of using their container. See
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-2017&pivots=cs1-bash
At the bottom of that page are references to two other pages that contain quite
a bit of informative information as well.

For now, I run "./setupMSSQL1.sh" from the myDatabase subdirectory to build
a clean docker container, mssql1.  I then go into it using:
        sudo docker exec -it mssql1 /bin/bash
Once inside, I do:
        cd rw
        ./setup.sh                  # if I need view
        ./load.sh                   # for my test myDatabase
        cd TeachYourselfSQL_MySQL   # To load their database
        ./create.sh
        ./populate.sh
        cd ..
        ./runSQL.sh                 # To verify that the databases are there.
        SELECT name from sys.Databases;
        go                          # TSQL doesn't seem to do anything until you do "go"
        quit
        exit
I might do other things in there, but that is the gist of what I normally do.

Got the sample sql for "Teach yourself SQL in 10 minutes".  However, it doesn't work
directly.  So, I am having to modify it to make it work.  I ran "/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -?"
and found out some errors that I was making in running it.

I can now recreate 3 sample databases in a docker MS Sql Server container from scratch.  So,
testing is now easier.  However, I cannot include the two databases because one is copyrighted
and you are only supposed to download it if you bought his book.  I have sent an email to the
author of the second database and am waiting to hear his reply.  He responded with:

"Absolutely, those database examples are downloadable by all and free to use as you need.
 You are free to post and use them as needed."

So, I am including them in this repository and a big thank you to Ben Forta.

The two books that I am referring to are:
        "Teach yourself SQL in 10 minutes" by Ben Forta, Pearson Education, Inc., 2013
        "Microsoft Sql Server 2012 T-SQL Fundamentals" by Itzik Ben-Gan, Microsoft Press, 2012
